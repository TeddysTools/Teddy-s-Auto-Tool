Show the version name at the top-left: “Teddy’s Auto Toolkit v1.0”

Use a matching bear icon on your taskbar and in the system tray

1) What you need (very simple)

A Windows PC: Windows 10 or 11, 64-bit recommended

Mouse & keyboard (built-in is fine)

Internet on first run (so Windows can fetch the few small pieces it needs)

If you download the ready-made EXE, you don’t need to install anything else.
If you download the source version, there’s a “Run” button (a .bat file) that sets things up for you automatically. No tech knowledge needed.

2) The fastest way to use it — Ready-Made EXE (Recommended)
Download & open (GitHub Releases or CurseForge)

Go to the project page (GitHub Releases tab or CurseForge files page).

Find the latest version (look for Teddy’s Auto Toolkit v1.0).

Download the Windows zip that says something like:
TeddysAutoToolkit-Windows.zip (or similar wording).

When your browser says it’s done, open your Downloads folder.

Right-click the zip file ➜ click Extract All… ➜ click Extract.

This makes a new folder with the files inside.

Important: Do not run programs from inside the zip. Always extract first.

Run it

Open the new folder you just extracted.

You should see TeddysAutoToolkit.exe and license.json together in that folder.

Double-click TeddysAutoToolkit.exe.

If Windows shows SmartScreen (“Windows protected your PC”):

Click More info ➜ Run anyway (this is normal for brand-new apps without a code-signing certificate).

The app opens. You’re in! 🎉

Tip: Want it on your taskbar? Right-click the running icon ➜ Pin to taskbar.

3) Alternate way — Source zip (auto-setup button inside)

Use this if you prefer the full folder with scripts, or if you don’t see a ready-made EXE download.

Download & open

From GitHub or CurseForge, download the source zip (it contains files like Toolkit.py, Run Teddy (auto-setup).bat, etc.).

Right-click the zip ➜ Extract All… ➜ Extract.

Open the new extracted folder.

One-click “Run”

Double-click Run Teddy (auto-setup).bat

It creates a private copy of Python inside this folder and installs what’s needed.

The first time can take a few minutes (only once).

After setup, the app starts automatically.

Optional: Make your own EXE (one click)

Double-click Build EXE (one click).bat

It builds TeddysAutoToolkit.exe and opens the folder when finished.

It also copies license.json next to the EXE for you.

You can move the EXE and the license.json together to any folder or USB.

If a window says “Python not found”, just follow the prompt to install Python 3.10+ (64-bit) from the official site. After installing, double-click the Run or Build file again.

4) Using the app (no tech skills needed)
What you see

Top-left: “Teddy’s Auto Toolkit v1.0”

Big panels for features: Auto Clicker, Hold Click, Auto Typer

Session info and Clear buttons for Total clicks and Longest hold

A cute bear in the corner that winks, waves, smiles, and wiggles its ears

Bottom-right of Windows: the bear icon in your system tray (near the clock)

Basic controls

Auto Clicker

Choose Button (Left/Middle/Right).

Set Clicks per second.

Click Start to begin, Stop to end.

While it’s on, a tiny note appears near your mouse: “Auto Clicker”.

Hold Click

Choose Button (Left/Middle/Right).

Click Hold to press-and-hold; click Release to let go.

The tiny note says “Click Hold” while active.

The Longest hold time updates automatically. Use Clear to reset.

Auto Typer

Type the text you want in the box (e.g., “Hello from Teddy!”).

Set the interval (how many seconds between types).

(Optional) Check “Press Enter after each” if you want a new line every time.

Click Start to begin, Stop to end.

The tiny note says “Typing” while active.

Hotkeys (keyboard shortcuts)

You can bind two-key combos like Ctrl + F1.

Click Bind key next to the hotkey you want, then press up to two keys at the same time.

If you make a mistake, click Clear and bind again.

There’s also a Kill switch you can bind, which immediately stops everything.

System tray (near the clock)

Find the bear icon. Click it (or right-click) for the menu:

Open — show the window if it’s hidden

Stop All — stop auto click/hold/type immediately

Quit — close the app completely

5) Requirements & specs (plain English)

Windows 10 or Windows 11 (64-bit best)

First run: Internet to fetch small setup pieces (only once)

If using the EXE: nothing else to install

If using the source: the Run button sets up everything for you automatically

Screen size: Any typical laptop/desktop is fine

Performance: Very light — even older PCs handle it well

6) Common questions / problems

Q: Windows said “Windows protected your PC”.
A: That’s SmartScreen being careful with new apps. Click More info ➜ Run anyway. The app is safe.

Q: When I double-click the EXE, nothing happens.
A: Make sure you extracted the zip first. Running from inside the zip won’t work. Also check that license.json is in the same folder as the EXE (they come together in the download).

Q: I ran the source version and it says Python is missing.
A: That’s okay. Install Python 3.10 or newer (64-bit) from the official site (the setup wizard is simple). Then double-click Run Teddy (auto-setup).bat again.

Q: My antivirus complained.
A: Auto-clickers sometimes get false alarms. You can allow the app, or use the ready-made EXE download if your antivirus is strict. We don’t include ads, miners, or anything shady.

Q: It says “License missing”.
A: The license.json file must sit in the same folder as the app (the EXE or Toolkit.py).

If you used the ready-made EXE, the license.json is included — keep it next to the EXE.

If you used the Build script, it automatically copies the license to the output folder for you.

Q: How do I stop everything quickly?
A: Use Stop All in the system tray menu, or press your Kill switch hotkey (if you set one).

7) Safety & fair-use notes

Some games and apps forbid auto-clickers. Use responsibly.

Don’t use it to spam or harass people.

If a site or game has anti-cheat, read their rules first.
